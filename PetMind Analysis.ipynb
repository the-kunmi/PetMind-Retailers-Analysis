The equipment category is the category with the most repeated purchases of all categories. The food, housing, medicine, toys categories have closely the same repeated purchases obsevations with accessory category being the least observation. The categories are unbalanced, with equipments category having the most repeated_purchases and medicine have the second most repeated purchases with quite a difference. The team should focus on the increasing the quantity of equipment category for increase in sales due to repeated purchases.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![image](image.png) \n\nAs the team thinks that the distrubution  of sales will be important  to  review, I  have plotted an histogram to  show  the distribution of sales. \n\nLooking at all sales, we can see from the graphic below that most  sales  peak from  850 to  1050  of sales.  The distribution of sales is a symmentrical  distribution  with other  sales  tailing off on both sides.\n\nIt shows that most sales are made  from products between the amount of  850 to  1050.  We can also  see  that products from  over 1060 don't make so much sales.\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![sales and repeat](sales%20and%20repeat.jpg)\n\nTo  describe the relationship between repeat purchases and sales I plotted a  box plot  to  show the relationship between them. \nThe first box plot variable(1) represents the relationship  between sales of products that are repeatedly bought while the second blox plot variable(0) represents the relationship  between sales of products  that are not repeatedly bought.  \nWe can recognise that both box plots have outliers in their groups of data, though there are more outliers in variable (1). We can also see that 50% of both sets of data overlap, their median points are close as well. Though the inter-quatile range of variable(1) is smaller than that of variable (0) which shows the points of variable(1) are closely  ranged.  This means that 50% of products that were repeatedly purchased range from over 700 to about 1200. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"}
